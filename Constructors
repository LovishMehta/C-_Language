Constructor
*************************

=> Constructor is a member function of a class.
=> The name of the constructor is the same as the name of the class.
=> It has no return type, so we can't use the return keyword.
=> It must be an instance member function that is, it can never be a static member function.
=> Constructor is implicitly invoked when an object is created.
( ye function apne aap call ho jata hai jab object bnai jaati hai.)
=> Constructor is used to solve the problem of intialization.

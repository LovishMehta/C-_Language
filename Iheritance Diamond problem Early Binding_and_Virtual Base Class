Early Binding

C obj;
obj.f4();

Whenever we call a function in a program, the work of compiler is to bind or map the function
call with its right defination. This is called early binding.

Virtual Base Class
Virtual base classes are used in virtual inheritance in a way of preventing multiple “instances”
of a given class appearing in an inheritance hierarchy when using multiple inheritances.

Class A
{
public:
int a;
}

class B1:public A
{
  public:
  int b;
}

Class B2: public A
{
  public:
  int b1;
}

Class C: public B1, public B2
{
 public:
 int c;
 }
 
 int main()
 {
   C obj;
   obj.a=10 // error because 2 copies of a got inherited 
  }
  
How to resolve this issue?
To resolve this ambiguity when class A is inherited in both class B and class C,
it is declared as virtual base class by placing a keyword virtual.

class B1:virtual public A
{
  public:
  int b;
}

Class B2:virtual public A
{
  public:
  int b1;
}

  This makes the Class A the virtual Base class of Class C

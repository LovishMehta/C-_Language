Middle level Programming (Low level programming (which near to hardware) + Middle level programming)

C++ joins three separate programming traditions
1. Procedural language tradition (same as C)
2. the Object Oriented language tradition represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C.
3. Generic Programming supported by c++ tempalates.

Comparision Between C and C++
1. C++ superset of C language (saare features hai jo C mai the aur thoda additions bhi aa gay hai)
2. C++ programs can use existing C software libraries ( we can use scanf(), printf(), getch() etc)
3. C adopts Procedure oriented Progrmming
4. C++ adopts Object oriented Programming (as well as Procedure oriented programming)

What is Object oriented Programming?
OOPs is a programming approach which revolves around the concept of "Object".

=> Any entity in the system that can be defined as a set of properties and set of operations performed using entity's
   property set, is known as Object.
   Also the variable created using class as a new data type is called an Object. (similar to concept of struct)
   
5 key principals Mentioned in object oriented programming.
1.Encapsulation.
2.Data Hiding
3. Abstraction.
4. Polymorphism.
5. Inheritance.

Classes and Objects

=>Class is a blueprint of an object
=>class is a description of Object's property set and set of operation
=>Creating class is as good as defining a "new data type".
=>Class is means to achieve encapsulation.
(Class ko memory ni milti, memory milti hai object ko jo us class ko use karke k banti hai.)
=>Object is a runtime entity.(i.e memory is allocated during runtime)

Example

Class box
{
 int l,b,h;
 void setDimension(int x,int y,int z)
 {...}
 };

int main()
{
  box b1;  // created a varible of data type box but here we say created an Object of Class Box
  }

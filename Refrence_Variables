Ordinary Variable
int x=5

pointer Variable
int *p (a variable which contains address of a variable)
p = &x;

New type of variable introduced in c++ called "Refrence Variable".

=> int &y=x;                   (y is a refrence variable and it should be initialized during declaration only)

(y mai x ka address aa gya hai par agar mai y++ karunga to x ki value increment hogi na ki adress jaise ki pointer mai hota hai.
 refrence variable is just a way to use x from some another variable.)
 
 PROPERTIES
=> Refrence means address
=> Refrence variable is an internal pointer (if asked in interview tell this)
=> Declaration of REfrence variable is preceded with '&' symbol(but do not read it as 'address of')
=> Refrence variable must be initialized during declaration
=> It can be initialized with already declared variables only.
=> Refrence variables cannot be updated.
( hum refrence variable mai ek baar koi value initialize kar de jaise ki upar x ki Kar di to vo dobar kabhi bhi change ni ki ja
  sakti. Unlike pointer it cannot be changed).

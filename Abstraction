Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
=> Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data
   to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation
   
Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing
the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car
but he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing,
he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, 
brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

Advantages of Data Abstraction:

Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code
Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.
Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

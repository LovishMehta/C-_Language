*********************
Static Local Variable
*********************

=> Concept as it is taken from C.
=> Static Local variables are by default initialized to Zero (0)
=> Their Lifetime is throughout the program.

Example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void fun()
{
	static int count;  // its a static local varible and by default it is intialized = 0

	count++;           // its lifetime is throughout the program
	cout<<"Value of count : "<<count<<endl;
}

int main()
{
	for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
	fun();
	return 0;
}

// OUTPUT: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

***********************
Static Member Variable
***********************
=> Declared inside the class body.
=> Also known as class variable. (different from instance memeber varible or data member)
=> They must be defined outside the class.
=> Static member variable does not belong to any object. It belongs to the class that's why called class variable.
=> There will be one copy of static members variable for the whole class.
=> Any object can use the same copy of class variable.
=> They can also be used with class name.
 

Example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Account
{
 int balance; // instance member variable
 static float roi; // static member variable or Class Variable
 
 public:
 void set(int b)
 {
  balance = b;
  }
}

flaot Account:: roi=3.5f; // the static variable must be declared outside also otherwise it will not work
                         // declaration is done using membership label.

(agar hum upar vali line likhte hai tabhi is variable ko memory milti hai par is variable ki memory object par depend nhi
 karti tabhi ise "class variabel" kha jata na ki instance variable.)
 
 void main()
 {
  clrscr();
  Account a1,a2;  // a1 object mai balance naam ka variable hoga , similarly a2 object mai bhi balance naam ka variable hoga
                     par "roi" variable ni hoga. "roi" variable poori class k liye sirf ek baar banega. 
                     "roi" variable ka ban na aur na ban na object p depend ni kargea, agar ek bhi object nhi bnayenge to bhi
                     "roi" variable banega. Aur 10 obejct bhi bnay to bhi "roi" variable ek baar hi banega.
}                     
 } 
 
**********************************
Static Member function
**********************************
=> They are qualified with keyword static.
=> They are also called class member functions.
=> They can be invoked with or without object.
=> They can only access static members of the class.

Example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Account
{
 int balance; // instance member variable
 static float roi; // static member variable or Class Variable
 
 public:
 void set(int b)
 {
  balance = b;
  }
static void fun(float r)  // static function can access only static members if the class (cannot access balance data member)
{
  roi = r;
}   
}

flaot Account:: roi=3.5f; 

 void main()
 {
  clrscr();
  Account a1;
  a1.fun(4.5)   // invoking using object
  
  Account :: fun(4.5) // invoking without object in case we have not created object of the class as we know static varible exists 
                         even if the object is not created.
  
}                     
 }

Identifiers can be functions names, variables, objects, Macros etc.

Constants: Any information is constant
           Data = information = constant
           
Types of Constant
1. Primary Constant
   i) Integer 1,-345,897
  ii) Real    3.4,-0.06,3.0
 iii) Character  'a','A','+','c'
 
2. Secondary costant (They are made using primary constants that's why called secondary constants)
  Array
  String    "saurabh"
  Pointer
  Union
  Structure
  Enumerator
  Class
  
  Variables : Variables are the names of the memory locations where we store data.
  => Variable name is any combination of alphabet (a to z or A to Z), digit(0 t0 9) and underscore(_)
  => Varible name cannot start with digit.
  
 3. Keywords: keywords are the reserved words which are known by the compiler and cannot be used as variable names.
 
 DATA TYPEs:
 1. int       int a=5,b=6;     //consumes 2 bytes/ 4bytes   // integer
 2. char      char c='a';      // consumes 1 byte           // character
 3. float     float k=3.45;    // consumes 4 bytes          // real
 4. double    double d1;       // consumes 8 bytes          // real
 5. void

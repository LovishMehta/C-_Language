The only difference between structure and class is that
=> The members of structures are by defualt "public"
    and, whereas
=> The members of class are by default "private" 

// All the members in this function are public by default and hence can be accessed from outside.
struct complex
{
  int a,b;
  
  void set data(int x,int y)
  { a=x; b=y;}
  void show_data()
  { cout<<"\na"<<a<<" b "<<b;
  }
}

// All the members in this function are "private" by default and hence cannot be accesed from outside withoud declaring public
class complex
{
  int a,b;
  
  void set data(int x,int y)
  { a=x; b=y;}
  void show_data()
  { cout<<"\na"<<a<<" b "<<b;
  }
}

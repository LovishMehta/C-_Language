STL is Standard template Library (predefined collection of classes)
It is a powerful set of C++ template classes

At the core of C++ Standard template Library are following three well structured components
- Containers
- Algorithms
- Iterators

!. Containers: Containers are used to manage collection of objects of a certain kind.
            -> Container Library in STL provide containers that are used to create data
               structures like arrays, linked list, trees etc.
            -> These Containers are generic, they can hold elements of any data types.   
            Example: vector
2. Algorithms: Algorithms act on containers. They provide the mean by which you will perform
               initialization, sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of container.
            -> Algorithms library contains built in functions that performs complex algorithms on data
               structures.
               e.g. reverse(), sort().
            -> Algorithims library provides abstraction, i.e. you don't necessarily need to know how
               the algorithms works.
              
3. Iterators : (Iteration means repetitions, iterator is similar to pointers which points to data stored in containers)
           -> Iterators are used to step through the elements of collection of objects. These collection may be
               containers or subsets of containers.
           ->  Iterators in STL are used to point to the containers.    
           ->  Iterators actually act as a bridge between containers and algorithms.
           E.g. sort() algorithm have two parameters, starting iterator and ending iterator.
